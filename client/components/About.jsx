                  <p>My name is Steve Torrens, and I am a software developer, based in Wellington, New Zealand. I have a background in mechanical engineering,
                    operations and policy. I have just finished contracting for a small start-up called Glimp, working
                    with Ruby on Rails. At the beginning of last year, I completed a boot camp at the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz">Enspiral Dev Academy</a> and
                    have experience in developing small applications in JavaScript and associated web technologies.
                    You can see examples of my Code on <a href="https://github.com/steve-dev90">GitHub</a>.</p>

                  <p>I am now available for work. If you need to know more get in touch with me.</p>
